= Create a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Cluster

Learn how to create a Kubernetes cluster on GKE in three clicks, using https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)].

To create a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster, you will need:

* A set of GKE credentials. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/kubernetes-service/create-auth-credentials-on-gke.html[Find Your GKE Credentials].
* An NKS account.

For more details, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/kubernetes-service/nks-requirements.html[our Requirements page].

== Step 1: Add Cluster

Log in to https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] and click **+ ADD CLUSTER**.

== Step 2: Provider Configuration

In this step, you will set your provider configurations. Here you can update any of the following if you wish:

* Number and size of master and worker nodes.
* Region.
* NKS workspace.
* GKE credentials.
* SSH keypair.

If everything looks good, click **Submit**.

== Step 3: Cluster Configuration

On the third and final step, you can make any desired changes to your cluster configuration:

* Update the cluster name.
* Change the Kubernetes version.
* Change the OS distribution.
* Add Solutions to the cluster from our solutions gallery, trusted charts, or add your own Helm chart repo.

When your cluster configurations are ready, click **Submit**. Your cluster will begin building, and will be ready for use within minutes.

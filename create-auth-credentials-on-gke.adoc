= Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Credentials

To create a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster through https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] you will need to either create a new GKE project and credentials, or get the Service Account JSON data from your existing GCE project.

== Create a New Set of GKE Credentials

To create a new set of GKE credentials you will need to:

1. Create a new project.
2. Enable the Google Kubernetes Engine API.
3. Create the credentials.

=== Create a New Project

NKS must be set up to manage a project within your Google Container Engine (GKE) account. To do this, log into the Google cloud console at https://console.cloud.google.com.

Click **Project** to open the drop-down menu.

In the pop-up window which appears, select an organization from the drop-down menu.

Click the **+** to Create Project.

Fill in "NKS" as the project name, then click **Create**.

It may take a few moments for the project to be created. After the task is complete, you will be redirected to the project Dashboard.

=== Enable the Google Kubernetes Engine API

The next step is to use the API Manager to enable the Google Kubernetes Engine API for this project. Click **APIs & Services > Dashboard** in the navigation column on the left.

This will take you to the API Manager Dashboard. Click **ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gke/click-enable-api.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Enable API]

This will take you to the API Library. Search for "Google Kubernetes Engine". From the search results, click **Kubernetes Engine API**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gke/click-kubernetes-engine-api.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Click Container Engine API]

This will take you to the Kubernetes Engine API page. Click **ENABLE** to enable the API.

=== Create Credentials

After the new project has been created, click the **Credentials** link on the left to create credentials.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gke/click-credentials.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Click Credentials]

In the pop-up window which appears, click **Create credentials**.

Fill out the following:

* In the **Service Account Name** field, give your account a name like `nks-admin`.
* For **Role** select **Project** > **Owner**.
* For **Key type** select **JSON**.

Then click **Create**.

The JSON credentials (keyset) will automatically be saved to your local computer.

Locate the new `.json` file in your downloads folder and open it with a plaintext editor such as Notepad. Copy and paste the contents into https://nks.netapp.io[the NKS website] when you create a new cluster.


== Find Your Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Credentials

To create a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster through https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] you will need the Service Account JSON data.

You can only view or download the Service Account JSON file when you create the key. However, you can create a new key at any time.

=== Create a New GKE Service Account Key

Log in to the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google cloud console]. Click **IAM & Admin**.

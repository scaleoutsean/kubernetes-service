summary: How to use the Notifications API resource for the NKS API.
---

= Notifications

The Notifications API resource lets you read notifications on your https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] account.

Notifications are scoped to the user account, as determined by the API key. Notifications cannot be updated, marked as read, or deleted through the API.

== GET All Notifications

Get the details for all existing notifications for the user.

NOTE: This query will return all notifications on the account, both read and unread. In most cases, the response from the API will be extensive. For better readability we recommend you pipe the results of the API request to a file as shown in the example request.

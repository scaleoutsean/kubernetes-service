== Add Nodes to an Existing Node Pool

From the main Control Plane view, click the *Cluster Name* to bring up specific cluster details.

From that screen click the *+ ADD WORKER* button.

The default node pool can be expanded by adding additional nodes.

NOTE: Instance type and most other parameters are fixed for existing node pools.

Adjust the number of nodes you wish to add to the node pool.

Use the *SUBMIT* button to apply the changes. You will be returned to the cluster details screen. Notice that the new node provisioning is now in progress.

== Create a New Node Pool

If you would like to provision nodes using a different instance type, you'll need to create a new node pool.

From the cluster detail screen, you'll click the *+ ADD WORKER* button. Use the *Node Pool* drop-down to select *<Create New>*.

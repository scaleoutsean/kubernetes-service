= Google Compute Engine (GCE) Credentials

To create a Google Compute Engine (GCE) cluster through https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] you will need to either create a new GCE project and credentials, or get the Service Account JSON data from your existing GCE project.

== Create a New Set of GCE Credentials

To create a new set of GCE credentials you will need to:

1. Create a new project.
2. Enable the Google Compute Engine API.
3. Create the credentials.

=== Create a New Project

NKS must be set up to manage a project within your Google Compute Engine (GCE) account. To do this, log into the Google cloud console at https://console.cloud.google.com.

Click **Project** to open the drop-down menu.

In the pop-up window which appears, select an organization from the drop-down menu.

Click the **+** to Create Project.

Fill in "NKS" as the project name, then click **Create**.

It may take a few moments for the project to be created. Once the task is complete, you will be redirected to the project Dashboard.

=== Enable the Google Compute Engine API

The next step is to use the API Manager to enable the Google Compute Engine API for this project. Click **APIs & Services > Dashboard** in the navigation column on the left.

This will take you to the API Manager Dashboard. Click **ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES**.

This will take you to the API Library. Click **Compute Engine API**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gce/compute-engine-api.png?raw=true[Google Compute Engine: Click Compute Engine API]

This will take you to the Compute Engine API page. Click **ENABLE** to enable the API.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gce/click-enable-api.png?raw=true[Google Compute Engine: Click ENABLE]

=== Create Credentials

After the new project has been created, click the **Credentials** link on the left to create credentials.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gce/click-credentials.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Click Credentials]

In the pop-up window which appears, click **Create credentials**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gce/create-credentials.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Create Credentials]

From the drop-down menu, choose **Service account key**.

Click the **Service account** drop-down menu and choose **New service account**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gce/service-account-drop-down.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Service account key]

Fill out the following:

* In the **Service Account Name** field, give your account a name like `nks-admin`.
* For **Role** select **Project** > **Owner**.
* For **Key type** select **JSON**.

Then click **Create**.

The JSON credentials (keyset) will automatically be saved to your local computer.

Locate the new `.json` file in your downloads folder and open it with a plaintext editor such as Notepad. Copy and paste the contents into https://nks.netapp.io[the NKS website] when you create a new cluster.

== Find Your Existing GCE Credentials

You can only view or download the Service Account JSON file when you create the key. However, you can create a new key at any time.

=== Create a New GCE Service Account Key

Log in to the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google cloud console]. Click **IAM & Admin**.

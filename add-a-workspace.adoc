= Add a Workspace to an NKS cluster

Learn how to add a workspace to an https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] cluster.

In NKS a workspace is part of the Organization toolset. A workspace allows us to group Teams and resources found under Setup together. This provides the ability to tailor access to the exact needs of a group of users.

For example, you may want to allow a certain team access to build and manage clusters at one particular hyperscaler. This can be accomplished by creating a workspace for that team (or teams). Then assign specific *Provider Credentials* to that workspace. The same process can be used to enable or restrict access to other resources found under *Setup*:

* Provider Credentials
* Solution Credentials
* Storage Credentials
* VCS (Version Control System) Credentials
* SSH Keys

== Add a Workspace

Log in to NKS and navigate to *Organization -> Workspaces*. You will see the list of current workspaces displayed.

You can now add a *Workspace Name* and choose which *Teams* will have access to this workspace. In this example, we'll name it _Version 2_ and include the _New Features_ and _QA_ teams.

Pressing the *SUBMIT* button will create the new workspace and return us to the *Workspaces* screen. Notice the new workspace _Version 2_ has been added to the list.
